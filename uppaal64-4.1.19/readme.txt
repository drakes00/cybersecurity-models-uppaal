1. Introduction
===============

This is the 4.1.15 release of UPPAAL 4.1 -- a model checker
for timed automata.

Note that UPPAAL is free for non-profit applications but we want all
users to fill in a license agreement. This can be done online on the
web site http://www.uppaal.com/ or by sending in the form attached
below.

Please refer to the commercial license agreement for commercial uses.

2. Installation 
===============

2.1 Microsoft Windows & GNU/Linux
---------------------------------

To install, unzip the zip-file. This should create the directory
uppaal-4.1.x containing at least the files uppaal, uppaal.jar, and the
directories lib, man, bin-Linux, bin-Win32, lib, man and demo. The
bin-directories should all contain the two files verifyta(.exe) and
server(.exe) plus some additional files, depending on the
platform. The demo-directory should contain some demo files with
suffixes .xml and .q.

Note that UPPAAL will not run without Java 2 installed on the host
system. Java 2 for SunOS, Windows95/98/Me/NT/2000/XP, and Linux can be
downloaded from http://java.sun.com.

The present version of UPPAAL does no longer support versions 1.1,
1.2, 1.3 and 1.4 of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE). You need at
least JRE 5, and we strongly recommend using the most recent version
available for your platform. Compatibility problems with Windows Vista
have been reported, however it is currently believed that these
problems are caused by the JRE. Please double check that you use the
latest JRE for Windows Vista before reporting any problems with
running Uppaal on Windows Vista.

To run UPPAAL on Linux systems run the script named 'uppaal'. To run
on Windows 95/98/Me/NT/2000/XP systems double click the file
uppaal.jar.

2.2 Apple Mac OS X
------------------

To install Uppaal on Mac OS X, double-click the disk image to open it
and then drag and drop the Uppaal.app application to the /Applications folder.

Make sure that Java 6 or above is activated (see the FAQ).

To run Uppaal, double-click the Uppaal.app application.
